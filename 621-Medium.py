## 621. Task Scheduler

## You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. 
## Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: 
## identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
## 
## â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
